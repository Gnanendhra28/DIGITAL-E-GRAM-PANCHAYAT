🌐 Digital E-Gram Panchayat

Digital E-Gram Panchayat is an innovative web application designed to modernize and streamline the delivery of Gram Panchayat services to citizens in rural areas. By digitizing the service request and management process, this system empowers both residents and Panchayat staff to operate more efficiently, transparently, and collaboratively. Citizens can access vital public services online, while staff and administrators can manage those requests with ease and accuracy.

📝 Project Overview
